Using Github Pages to host a simple personal site is part of my professional development task this year. It was challenging as I had literally no experience with html coding.
I played around with the tutorial delivered by [Hank Quinlan](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/), and launched a super simple site. Well, the instructions are easy to follow, but it still appears a bit fuzzy to me as why we did each step the way it was. My current plan is to stick to the tutorial to get at least a feel of how a website would like and feed in the contents. After I am done with the basics, I would be happy to learn more about the actual coding and try to advance the site bit by bit in the future.
